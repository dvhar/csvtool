next steps:
    more query language features
        -aggragates, between, expressions
    more powerful gui
        -show more data
        -query building


figure out joins:
    -have 2 files
    -load just cols to join from 1st file where conditions match query
        -include file pointers to row they came from
    -scan second file
        -when find query match, bin search array from 1st file
        -for all join matches:
            -go to file pointer and get row
            -append columns from both files and save



current BNF:
<PreParseTokens> -> <Select> <From> <Where> <Order>
<Select>     -> <top> <Selections>
<top>        -> top INT | ε
<Selections> -> <column> <Selections> | * <Selections> | <Special> <Selections> | ε
<column>     -> column | quotedColumn
<Special>    -> distinct <column> | <Function> | <Case> //last 2 not implemented yet, but fit here nicely
<From>       -> from filename <alias>
<alias>      -> as alias | ε
<Where>      -> where <Conditions>
<Conditions> -> <Compare> <More> | ( <Conditions> ) <More>
<More>       -> logop <Conditions> | ε
<Compare>    -> <column> <Rel>
<Rel>        -> relop value | between value and value
<Order>      -> order by <column> <OMethod> | ε
<Omethod>    -> asc | ε
